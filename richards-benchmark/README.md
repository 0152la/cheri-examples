# Richards benchmark

Richards is an OS task scheduler simulation benchmark, designed for 
comparing system implementation languages. The benchmark was originally
implemented in BCPL by Martin Richards.
See https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/Bench.html for details.
This is a CHERI-compatible version of the Richards benchmark, with
optional support for BoehmGC. The code is derived from Stefan Marr's
classic benchmarks repository at
